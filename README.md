# single-cell-sequencing
scripts and functions to analyse single-cell sequencing data


#### OPTIONAL: Merge CS1-type libraries into one 384-column long CS2-type file 
- do this ONLY if you have CS1-style (4 libraries in one plate) data that you want to run this script on
- this assumes the order of A1=lib1, A2=lib2, B1=lib3, B2=lib4 when it reorders the columns
